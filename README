1) Movie App
Visually appealing application where users can search any movie they want to watch and the corresponding movie(s) will be displayed in a grid manner (column X row) based on if the searched movie is contained in the title regardless if perfect match. Users can also rate, review, and view other users' reviews on each movie. 
>Extra Features: When user hovers mouse over a movie, the original html is replaced with new html that contains 1) the description of the movie and 2) the reviews button that once pressed leads to the already mentioned reviews section. When user "unhovers", the original movie html is displayed.
